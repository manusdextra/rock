# Rock Paper Scissors

I have just started learning React and figured I should work on a project to better internalise what I've picked up. So I chose a simple game that wouldn't require a lot of mental overhead to implement.

I've also taken this opportunity to experiment with TailwindCSS and the associated tooling, which will hopefully not be too distracting.

## Status

So far, I've implemented the logic, and I've started learning about useState() and useEffect(). These have been difficult to wrap my head around, but the documentation has been a big help.
